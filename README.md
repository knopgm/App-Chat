## How to run the project:

You can use any Emulator or Simulator to run the app on your device. To test this app, I have used Expo Go on iOS. To test the app with Expo, follow the below steps:

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/knopgm/App-Chat.git`

2. Install Expo CLI as a global npm package: `npm install --global expo-cli`

3. Install all dependecies: `npm install`

4. Start project: `expo start` or `npm start`

5. Launch the app on Expo
